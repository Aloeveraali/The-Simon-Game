# Simon Memory Game 
This project is a web-based version of the classic Simon Memory Game. The game flashes colored buttons, and the player must repeat the sequence. The game progressively becomes more 
challenging as the sequence gets longer and faster. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# How to Play
Press the START button to begin.
Wait 3 seconds for the first signal.
Click the buttons in the same order they flash.
Continue as long as you can repeat the sequence correctly. The speed increases at specific intervals.
If you fail, all buttons will flash, and the game ends.
Your score and high score are displayed on the screen.
